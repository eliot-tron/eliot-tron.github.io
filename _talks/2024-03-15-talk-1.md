I was a regional finalist in [MT180](https://mt180.fr/) (Three minute thesis), a pop-science contest. My entry [here](https://youtu.be/z-KOKi9G7ZA?feature=shared) (in french). I learned a lot on how to share important but technical informations with any profile, and in the most effective and fun way.
