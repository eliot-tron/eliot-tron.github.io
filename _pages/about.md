# About me
I am a french PhD candidate in Computer Science and Mathematics at [ENAC](https://optim.recherche.enac.fr/) in Toulouse under the supervising of [Nicolas Couëllan](https://perso.math.univ-toulouse.fr/couellan/), [Rita Fioresi](https://www.dm.unibo.it/~fioresi/) and [Stéphane Puechmorel](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Stephane-Puechmorel-10132359). I am interested in theoretical Machine Learning, and more generally in statistics, probability and geometry. I work on geometric Deep Learning and Robustness. I am also a musician and I hope that someday I will be able to apply my work in ML to music.
