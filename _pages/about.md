I am a french Postdoc in Computer Science and Mathematics at [SAMM](https://samm.pantheonsorbonne.fr/) in Paris under the supervising of [Alain Celisse](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/alain.celisse@), [Alice Le Brigant](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/alice.-brigant@) and [Christophe Denis](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/page-perso/christophe.denis1%40). I am interested in theoretical Machine Learning, and more generally in statistics, probability and geometry. I work on geometric Deep Learning and Robustness. I am also a musician and I hope that someday I will be able to apply my work in ML to music.
