This recipe comes from my father. For a 8 serving _Galette des rois_, use 500g of flour.

## Ingredients
- 100g of flour (T45-55)
- 60g of vegan butter (:warning: 70% fat or more)
- some water

## Instructions
1. Mix the flour with the water to get a ball not too dry, with the same firmness as the cold vegan butter.
2. Put the dough ball in the fridge and take out the butter.
3. Flatten the butter between two sheets of parchment paper so that it forms a 5mm thick rectangle.[^1] Then put it in the fridge.
4. For the first turn: get the dough out of the fridge, and flatten it until its length is 3 times the width of the butter, and its width is equal to the length of the butter.
5. Put the butter on the dough and fold it in 3.
6. Flatten it until you reach the same size as before.
7. Rotate it 90° and fold again.
8. Put it in the freezer for 15min or in the fridge for 30min.
9. Get the dough out and redo step 4-8 twice.
10. Now your puff pastry is ready. Use it how you like. Cook it 45min at 180°C


[^1]: Fold the edges of the parchment paper to trap the vegan butter inside. It will be easier.
