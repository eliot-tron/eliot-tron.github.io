This recipe comes from my father. For a _Galette des rois_ (8 servings), use 500g of flour.

## Ingredients
- 100g of flour (T45-55)
- 60g of vegan butter (:warning: 70% fat or more)
- some water

## Instructions
1. Mix the flour with the water until you have a ball that is not too dry and has the same consistency as the cold vegan butter.
2. Put the dough ball in the fridge and take the butter out.
3. Flatten the butter between two sheets of parchment paper so that it forms a rectangle 5mm thick .[^1] Then put it in the fridge.
4. For the first turn: take the dough out of the fridge, and flatten it until its length is 3 times the width of the butter, and its width is equal to the length of the butter.
5. Put the butter on the dough and fold it in 3.
6. Flatten it until it is the same size as in step 4.
7. Turn it 90° and fold it again.
8. Put it in the freezer for 15 minutes or in the fridge for 30 minutes.
9. Take the dough out and repeat steps 4-8 twice.
10. Now your puff pastry is ready. Use it as you like. Bake it at 180°C for 45 minutes.


[^1]: Fold the edges of the parchment paper to the desired size to trap the vegan butter inside. This will make it easier to keep the butter at the right shape.
