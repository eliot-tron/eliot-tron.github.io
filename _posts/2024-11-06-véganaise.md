This recipe is inspired from one that I looked up on [vegan pratique](https://vegan-pratique.fr/) or [France vegetalienne](https://francevegetalienne.fr/) (I don't remember which one). This recipe makes approximately 20cl of vegan mayo I would say (but I never really measured it after making it). Store in the fridge for a few days / weeks (it's mainly oil after all). 

## Ingredients
- 5 tbsp aquafaba (the liquid from a can of chickpeas or other beans)
- 1 tbsp cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp mustard[^1]
- 1 pinch of Kala namak aka black salt (optional)[^2]
- Some neutral oil

## Instructions
1. Blend all the ingredients except the oil until smooth.
2. Gradually add the oil while continuing to blend until you have the desired consistency. After a few minutes you should have a thick vegan mayo. If not, add more oil.


[^1]: Make sure to use one without seeds, it will be easier to blend / emulsify.
[^2]: Kala namak salt has a distinct egg-like smell due to its sulphur content, use it if you like this taste.
